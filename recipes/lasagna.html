        <li>12 sheets no-cook lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>21 slices provolone cheese</li>
        <li>1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook onion in olive oil over 
            medium heat until tender, 4-5 minutes. Add garlic;
            cook 1 minute. Stir in tomato paste and cook, 
            stirring constantly, until fragrant, 3-4 minutes. 
            Add crushed tomatoes, water, fresh basil, 2 teaspoons
            sugar and salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Simmer 
            1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, cook bulk sausage in a skillet over medium 
            heat until no longer pink, breaking into crumbles, 8-10 
            minutes; drain. Add to sauce; simmer until mixture is 
            thickened, about 1 hour longer.</li>
        
        <li>While sauce simmers, preheat oven to 350Â°. Place sausage 
            links on a rimmed baking sheet; roast until cooked through,
            35-40 minutes. Remove and let cool slightly; slice into 
            1/4-in.-thick pieces.</li>
        
        <li>In a small bowl, mix ricotta cheese, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, 
            egg, dried basil and remaining 1/4 teaspoon sugar.</li>

        <li>In a greased 13x9-in. baking dish, spread 2 cups sauce. Arrange 
            4 noodles over sauce; spread with a third of the ricotta mixture. 
            Add 7 provolone slices, a third of the sliced sausage and 1-1/2 
            cups mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers 2 more times, using only 
            1 cup sauce per layer. Spread with 2 cups sauce (reserve remaining 
            sauce for serving on the side), remaining 2-1/2 cups mozzarella 
            cheese and the Parmesan cheese (dish will be full).</li>

        <li>Place dish on a rimmed baking sheet and bake, uncovered, until 
            bubbly and deep golden brown, 60-65 minutes. Let stand 15 minutes 
            before serving. Serve with remaining meat sauce.</li>
